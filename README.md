# AutomaticQA_generation

This repo provides the updated version of Automatic QA generation.
I have refered to the following repository: https://github.com/AIAnytime/Question-Answer-Generation-App
With some updated versions of langchain libraries the refered repo is used for the QA pair generation from the document (MLRC 1966 H-634 The  Maharashtra  Land  Revenue  Code, 1966.)
